# Vesper cycle log

IMPROVE-step persistence: one entry per completed cycle of the canonical Vesper cycle
(SPEC → PLAN → BUILD → TEST → REVIEW → SIMPLIFY → IMPROVE → SHIP). Capture spec deltas, lessons,
and reusable patterns. Even with nothing to note, record "no deltas — pattern held". When Linear
MCP is unavailable, status transitions are also mirrored here for manual reconciliation.

## Foundation — bootstrap (no Linear issue; kickoff authorization)

- Repo confirmed empty post-reset (prior `claw-village` experiments deleted in `e9d8cf5`,
  preserved in git history). No `.archive/` step needed.
- Session-start Linear cross-check found DEV-86/87/88 described an SDK-router architecture
  contradicting the kickoff (CLI shell-out, no provider SDKs). Omar adjudicated: kickoff
  architecture + naming win; reconcile Linear by rewriting the off-issues (show-before-write);
  split Foundation into 7 per-feature issues.
- Wrote `CLAUDE.md` (durable contract) + this log. Next: Bun workspace + package scaffold.
- No deltas — bootstrap proceeded per kickoff.
